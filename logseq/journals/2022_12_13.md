	- you may have seen a lot of [[Solidity]] code like:
	  ```
	  uint foo_ = foo;
	  foo_.bar();
	  foo_.baz();
	  ```
	  it's basically just to avoid reading [[storage]] over and over
	  we're kind of trying to do that automatically for users
	  exactly the kind of detail we want to try to bundle up into [[rainlang]] 
	  although a [[linked list]] is probably not significantly more [[gas]] efficient than reading storage, still good to standardise the process
	  i bet this one thing shows up thousands of times in [[audit]] every year
	  because it uses a [[linked list]] under the hood it has to convert that to a [[uint[]]] ]
	  do you know what i mean?
	- so for a none [[Orderbook]] expression
	  it is like contract -> contract -> [[kv]] ?
	  because I only see one [[mapping]] in [[Rainterpreter]]
	  [[msg.sender]] -> [[namespace]] -> [[kv]]
	  always
	  yes so for none ob contracts, those that can do [[k/v storage]], [[namespace]] is the same as [[msg.sender]]?
	  say [[Flowl]] contract
	  [[msg.sender]] is [[Flowl]] contract, [[namespace]] is also [[Flow]] contract
	  [[namespace]] is 0 in that case
	  can a contract set the 2 types of [[namespaces]] at the same time?
	  like be [[public]] one and [[private]] one?
	  like have some [[storage]] like contract -> 0 -> k/v
	  and some other like contract -> owner -> k/v
	  the answer is that the contract sets the [[namespace]] when it calls IInterpreterV2.[[evalWithNamespace]] instead of IInterpreterV2.[[eval]]
	  each onchain entity of the [[interpreter]], calling contract and [[expression]] sets its own [[namespace]] and they all combine into an overall sandbox
	- letâ€™s add a place for [[interpreter-ts]] and [[forecast]]/simulation too
	- actually i'm hoping if it's really easy to just spin up and link pages, that everyone can get more involved in writing things up [[logseq]]
	  we already have docs for [[rainlang]] and [[expression]] writing
	  a few paragraphs of dot points goes a long way
	  but needing to write a 10 page doc is pretty overwhelming
	  i think most of them are just generated from incoming references
	  if you click on one in [[logseq]] you'll see it just puts the incoming info there
	  which is actually pretty cool you can meta-document something just by [[tagging]] it
	  which is way better than a normal [[wiki]]
	  there's also a [[GPT]] plugin on the marketplace that i saw @highonhopium_josh
	  literally if ppl just copy and paste in bits of conversations in the journal and tag stuff, that will auto generate a ton of docs
	  there's a [[TG bot]] in the marketplace too
	  and i saw a [[merge plugin]] that can combine pages if there's a typo etc.
	  @rouzwelt https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/publishing%20(desktop%20app%20only)
	  looks like native support for turning it into a [[static site generator]]
	  could even make a [[rainlang]] plugin ðŸ˜‰
	  what would it do?
	  some [[syntax highlighting]] would be nice
	- @rouzwelt dunno if you saw the convo i was having with @highonhopium_josh around whether [[literate style]] might work for rainlang
	  that would really make [[studio]] truly like python/r stuff
	- yeah just do some [[tagging]]
	  does it put literally everything in there?
	  is the idea that someone goes through and links everything up?
	  if we can harness our raw TG stream of consciousness somehow that would be amazing
