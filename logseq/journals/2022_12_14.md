	- [[loop-n]]
	  shouldnt the number of inputs and outputs be the same all the times?
	  if so then why do we have outputSize in the operand?
	  that restriction is only for do while, because we know it loops n times we can calculate the stack diff due to an input and output mismatch
	- @thedavidmeister if an [[k/v item]] doesnt exist, and you [[get]] it, would it [[stack]] 0 as a result or reverts?
	  0
	  Thatâ€™s my understanding
