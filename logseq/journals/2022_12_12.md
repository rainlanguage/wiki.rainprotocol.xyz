- Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:28:03]:
  this is the problem
  i don't understand the new features/changes like you do
  i know you try to involve me in the changes you're making early on but im hardly ever in the headspace to absorb what you're telling me
  because im still trying to wrap my head around the thing from weeks ago
  i need [[documentation]] 
  not [[telegram]] pings
  please just describe what you've done in a [[PR]]
  perhaps even [[diagrams]] idk
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:33:52]:
  i try to do about a day's worth of documentation every week
  Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:34:18]:
  are you referring to [[PR]] [[documentation]]?
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:34:32]:
  also [[documentation]] on our [[documentation repo]]
  and i spend hours on [[telegram]] explaining stuff
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:38:28]:
  what are you doing to [[documentation]] and track your [[testing plans]] ?
  other than the [[tests]] themselves?
  Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:39:19 (12 Dec 2022 at 09:39:25)]:
  i have a [[saved telegram messages]] backlog and my own notepad when i need it
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:39:27]:
  we do have 700 [[tests]] , it's a fair chunk of code
  ok that's useful
  Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:40:17]:
  i save every message you ping me
  which refers to a potential test
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:40:44]:
  i find all the time i spend discussing things in [[telegram]] very valuable because often after i talk about it with the team things change
  but it does take a fair bit of time, and doing the docs repo as well, and also planning things like sketches
  Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 09:46:07]:
  i do like working with you early though
  into a new feature
  because it definitely leads to a more robust [[design]]
  Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:15:06]:
  yeah i've used that before
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:15:29]:
  is it good?
  Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:15:40]:
  its my favourite graph-based notetaking app
  i havent used it collaboratively though
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:16:00]:
  it's written with [[datascript]] in [[clojure]] ðŸ™‚
  i just went to see if [[tonsky]] had anything ðŸ˜‚
  maybe we could?
  Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:00]:
  im super down
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:08]:
  it's [[markdown]] based yeah?
  Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:12]:
  yep
  superset of [[markdown]]
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:25]:
  would it make sense to layer it over a [[static site generator]]?
  or, does it render sites that ppl can use?
  Marcus Newton, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:17:48]:
  just has some stuff like [[Double Brackets]] for tagging other pages
  thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 10:18:01]:
  can we serve the pages somehow?

- ## https://github.com/beehive-innovation/rain-protocol/pull/491
  There's a [[PR]] up for a [[stack highwater]] in the [[integrity check]]
-
- # dm notes
- got some logic up for [[stack highwater]] over the weekend, it is potentially gnarly for QA, seems relatively straightforward to think about the happy path but i'm not sure if it subtly breaks somehow or how to test for that
- still need to get an [[expression registry]] working before we attempt [[stakepreter audit]], that's the main thing on my mind this week for new code
- thinking about how we can guard against state changes in the future using a static call to self on the interpreter, but that is highlighting the need for [[base context]] to always include [[msg.sender]] and [[address(this)]] from the perspective of the [[calling contract]], if we do a static call to self then both of those values will be the interpreter which makes [[caller]] and [[this-address]] both useless
-
- # namespace notes
- rouzwelt, [12 Dec 2022 at 20:17:38 (12 Dec 2022 at 20:18:28)]:
  are ob order [[expression namespace]] like contract -> owner -> k/v
- or just owner -> k/v
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 20:20:41]:
  this
- there's always contract at the top
- rouzwelt, [12 Dec 2022 at 20:20:57]:
  ok
- but for calling an exp, do you need to be contract necessarily?
- I mean the sender needs to be the contract?
- or anyone can eval an exp
- no matter who deployed it
- ob or no ob, I mean in general
- I mean mostly the case for ob, the caller is always the ob contract right?
- caller of exp
- but it has access to that running orderâ€™s kv storage
- when evaling
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 20:28:31]:
  yeah
- rouzwelt, [12 Dec 2022 at 20:28:51]:
  so for a none ob expression
- it is like contract -> contract -> kv
- ?
- because I only see one mapping in Rainterpreter
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 20:29:48]:
  msg.sender -> namespace -> kv
- always
- rouzwelt, [12 Dec 2022 at 20:30:27]:
  yes so for none ob contracts, those that can do k/v storage, namespace is the same as msg-sender?
- say FLOW contract
- msg.sender is FLOW contract, namespace is also FLOW contract
- thedavidmeister, [12 Dec 2022 at 20:31:29]:
  namespace is 0 in that case

- # nix-shell
- Exactly, we use [[nix-shell]] for as much as possible to minimise "works on my machine" occurrences
