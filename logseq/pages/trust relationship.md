- The designer of the [[calling contract]] has to define the [[trust relationship]] between the [[expression/author]] and [[expression/caller]].
- The simplest scenario is a [[factory]] where some [[EOA]] deploys a [[child]] and [[initialises]] it with an [[immutable]] reference to an [[expression]]. All the [[entrypoint]] are deployed together and cannot be changed after [[initialisation]]. Each [[child]] has its own [[expression]] and [[state]] and so cannot interfere with each other. Anyone can be an [[expression/auditor]] of the [[expression]] as [[initialised]] and decide for themselves whether to use this [[child]] as an [[expression/caller]], or move on to some other [[child]], or deploy their own alternative [[expression]] as a new [[expression/author]].
- This simple scenario works best when the [[factory/child]] is associated with some [[event]], such as a [[sale]], or real world [[event]], or where there are some natural bounds on the process where it is reasonable to expect an [[immutable]] [[expression]] to be relevant for the natural lifespan of the [[factory/child]] [[calling contract]].
- More complex scenarios may be afforded and even required by some [[calling contract]]. For example, in the `[[Orderbook]]` [[calling contract]] in core, each order is its own [[expression]] with its own [[interpreter]]. Traders can only give themselves a worse price if they select a malfunctioning/malicious [[interpreter]], so they are free to select for themselves where/how their [[expression]] runs to calculate the price of their trades. Each [[matchmaking bot]] can perform static analysis of the expression using the [[constraints engine]] as an automated [[expression/auditor]] before it decides to become an [[expression/caller]].
- Even more complex scenarios may require full [[onchain]] governance apparatus such as is commonly found in [[defi]] for a certain class of long lived protocols. The advantage of [[DAO]] style governance via. [[expression]] is that the expression can be proposed and deployed directly by the [[onchain governance]] process, rather than some [[offchain vote]] feeding into a lengthy/centralised/opaque [[Solidity]] development process, to finally be [[onchain]] after some delays and potential misunderstandings.
