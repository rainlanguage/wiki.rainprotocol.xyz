- The rust book has a pretty [good explanation](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/the-stack-and-the-heap.html) of what a [[stack]] is in a general sense
- The [[evm]] is stack based as well, basically every [[programming language]] uses stacks somewhere, somehow, but the programmer-user may or may not be aware as the [[high level]] [[abstraction]] of the language may hide the details of the stack completely
- in [[rainlang]] the [[stack]] is a [[first class]] concept as the [[stack]] movements are [[deterministic]] and can be calculated at [[compile time]]
	- in general this is not possible e.g. consider a [[loop]] that has an [unpredictable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) number of iterations and puts 1 item on the stack each iteration, in this case it is impossible to know how many items will be on the stack when the loop completes
	- [[rainlang]] uses the [[expression deployer]] to run an [[expression/integrity check]] to calculate each [[pop]] and [[push]] to the [[stack]] including intermediate pops and pushes within the logic of a single [[word]], not simply the [[net stack movement]]. Any [[word]] that cannot calculate its [[gross stack movement]] at [[compile time]] will have [[undefined behaviour]] at [[runtime]] because the [[interpreter]] will be unable to [[allocate]] the correct [[memory region]] needed for the [[stack]] to [[read]] and [[write]]
