- If an existing [[calling contract]] exists that provides reasonable economic and security guard rails around some [[expression]], or it is possible to write a new [[expression]] and reuse an existing [[calling contract]], it is best to build a new [[front end]] rather than a new [[calling contract]].
- [[Front end]] can be targetted to a specific [[expression]] or family of [[expression]] in a permissionless way. If an existing [[calling contract]] can do the job it has higher [[lindy]] in real world scenarios than any new contract, and existing [[tooling]] can already render and display its [[expression]] with associated [[expression metadata]].
- For example the `[[Sale]]` contract can and has been used to build several token launchpad [[front end]], each with their own specific needs and target audience. A `[[Sale]]` can even be embedded in an existing website for a once-off launch, without permission or fees being paid to other [[front end]] pointing to the same underlying contracts.
