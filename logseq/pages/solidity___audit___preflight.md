- Things to check before sending solidity code to audit
	- [[slither]] is clean
		- running latest version of [[slither]]
		- all remaining issues checked for false positives
	- [[pin dependencies]] using `=` syntax in [[semver]]
		- ensure all dependencies are up to date when pinning
	- remove unused or marginally useful dependencies
	- remove duplicate dependencies, favour transitive dependencies already included upstream
	- review [[license]]
	- Check sentence case and full stops on sentences, other grammar etc. in comments
	- Ensure every function, struct and event is commented
	- review readme
