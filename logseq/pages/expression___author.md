- An [[expression]] can be produced in several ways:
	- Manually byte by byte, which sounds painful but isn't so bad once you know the basics. There are literally hundreds of [[unit tests]] doing this in the main [[Rain]] repository so examples abound for the control freaks out there ;)
	- Using the [[rainlang/parser]] to convert a human friendly representation that is recognisable as "code" for an [[expression]] down to the equivalent [[bytes]]. This is the approach taken by [[Studio]] as it allows the same expressivity as the per-byte approach, but with far less tedium.
	- Using a dedicated [[front end]] that hides some or all the [[Rain]] details away from the [[end user]]. As == [[interpreter/calling contract]] are still just regular [[EVM]] contracts there is no reason the [[end user]] will necessarily care to read all the implementation details if they have a [[trust relationship]] with some product. For example, who is reading the [[Aave]] contracts every time they call a function, and re-reading every time the [[Aave]] team launches a new update? We strongly recommend that the [[front end]] provides some link to an interface that can display the [[expression]], much like links to [[etherscan]] to read the [[verified code]], but this can be an "advanced" feature most of the time.
	  
	  In all cases the [[JavaScript]] SDK and [[interpreter]]/ [[expression metadata]] is the recommended way to ensure the integrity and intent of expressions are respected and make it to the final destination intact.
