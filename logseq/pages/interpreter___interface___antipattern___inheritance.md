- This is the "old skool" way to interact with [[Rain]] and is probably less useful as the external [[interpreter/interface]] stabilises and overall number of [[word]] increases. It is possible to [[inherit]] the [[interpreter]] and call `[[eval]]` internally rather than call a standalone [[interpreter]]. The benefit is that your contract has full control over the supported opcode logic, losing the [[interpreter/advantages/decentralised extension points]] in exchange for an [[immutable]] operating environment. However, the same thing can be achieved by setting the external [[interpreter]] as an [[immutable]] value on the [[calling contract]] itself.
- There are also some modest [[gas]] benefits to calling `[[eval]]` locally rather than as an [[external contract call]]. This is offset somewhat by the large [[code size]] implied by compiling dozens of [[word]] into the [[calling contract]], which can lead to external calls anyway due to splitting out logic elsewhere as the 24.5kb [[code size]] limit is approached.
